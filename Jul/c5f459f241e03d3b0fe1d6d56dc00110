ZIMBABWE Cricket will appear before the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) on July 16 to explain the senior national team’s trip to Pakistan which was not sanctioned by the supreme sports body. BY SPORTS REPORTER This was revealed by SRC director general Charles Nhemachena when he appeared before the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Education, Arts, Sports and Culture chaired by Tapiwa Matangaidze. The SRC was asked to explain if they were going to take any disciplinary measures against ZC which went to Pakistan without SRC approval. “We did summon Zimbabwe Cricket and they were charged for undertaking the trip without approval.  They asked for time to go and prepare for their defence and it was agreed the hearing will be conducted on July 16,” Nhemachena said. The senior cricket team went to Pakistan in May where they played two T20 matches and three One Day Internationals between May 22 and 31, against advice from SRC not to undertake the trip. There was a deadly explosion outside the stadium in Lahore during the second ODI. There has not been international cricket in Pakistan since March 3, 2009 when gunmen attacked the Sri Lanka national cricket team on their way to the Gadhafi Stadium in Lahore. Eight players were killed during the attack, and some players were injured, leading to an international boycott by teams.
Pakistan then played most of their ‘home games’ in Dubai. Zimbabwe agreed to travel after the Pakistan Cricket Board gave them financial incentives, including $12,500 to each player, although the chairman of the board Shahayrar Khan rubbished media reports that it was a bribe to the ZC board to undertake the tour.
